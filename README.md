# variables_csharp

Created an application that does the following:

- Created a variable that stores the numberOfCupsOfCoffee that the user drinks every day
- Created a variable that is called fullName and it is equal to the users full name
- Created a variable that displays the current date using DateTime.Today
- Application prints out the variables numberOfCupsOfCoffee, fullName, and today, displays them

Able to have the application to ask for user input by:

- Asking the user for their name and storing it in a variable named userName
- Printing out a greeting to the user, using their name
- Asking the user to input two numbers
- Getting the numbers as strings using Console.ReadLine, storing them in variables named firstNumberAsString and secondNumberAsString
- Converting string inputs into numbers
- Converted each string above to a double using Double.parse. Save the first value in a variable named firstOperand and the second value in a variable named secondOperand

Having the application perform math equations by:

- Adding the operand variables and saving the results in a variable named sum
- Subtracting the secondOperand variable from the firstOperand variable and saving the results in a variable named difference
- Multiplying the operand variables and saving the results in a variable named product
- Dividing the firstOperand by the secondOperand and save the results in a variable named quotient
- Finding the remainder when one operand is divided by the other and save the results in a variable named remainder
- Using Console.WriteLine to present the user each of the values for the sum, difference, quotient, product, and remainder variables
